# Mandel

This is a very simple, single-file MacOS program for plotting
the Mandelbrot set. I remember the idea for this application
came from a friend who was fascinated by the math.

If I remember correctly, the only action the user can take on
the application's window is to select a region. The screen would
then redraw the selected region on the full window. This allows
a user to explore the recursive nature of the set.

This project is dated May 1990.
